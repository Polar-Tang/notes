We could see that in this 

A file upload may be posible, but nginx is designed to serve files only from explicitly configured directories


A webshell may not be posible, because there's only the functionality of save the image in client side, as result the only arbitrary code execution may exists is Javascript, the proggraming language run by the client side. Any attempt of creating a file of a mime type that could not be used by the browser will result in `save response as...'` dialog.
