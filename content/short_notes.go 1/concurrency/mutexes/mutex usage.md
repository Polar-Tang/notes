This is important because *In Go, it isn’t safe to read from and write to a map at the same time*. if a mutex is reading data, and other thread is changing that data, in go, it will cause a state panic because it can be accessing to corrupted information. This script will cause an error
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	m := map[int]int{}
	go writeLoop(m)
	go readLoop(m)

	// stop program from exiting, must be killed
	block := make(chan struct{})
	<-block
}

func writeLoop(m map[int]int) {
	for {
		for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
			m[i] = i
		}
	}
}

func readLoop(m map[int]int) {
	for {
		for k, v := range m {
			fmt.Println(k, "-", v)
		}
	}
}
```
If we want to avoid that panic state, i don't know why you wouldn't want to, let's use the mutex:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	m := map[int]int{}

	mu := &sync.Mutex{}

	go writeLoop(m, mu)
	go readLoop(m, mu)

	// stop program from exiting, must be killed
	block := make(chan struct{})
	<-block
}

func writeLoop(m map[int]int, mu *sync.Mutex) {
	for {
		for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
			mu.Lock()
			m[i] = i
			mu.Unlock()
		}
	}
}

func readLoop(m map[int]int, mu *sync.Mutex) {
	for {
		mu.Lock()
		for k, v := range m {
			fmt.Println(k, "-", v)
		}
		mu.Unlock()
	}
}
```
