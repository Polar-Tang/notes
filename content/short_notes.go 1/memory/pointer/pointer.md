When we assign a variable, we are storing that value in someplace of the memmory
```go
x := 42
// "x" is the name of a location in memory. That location is storing the integer value of 42
```
So when wo use a pointer we are "pointing" to that address in memmory, and not the value by itself.

**This is de syntax for a pointer**:
```go
var p *int
```
The `&` operator generates a pointer to its operand.
```go
myString := "hello"
myStringPtr := &myString

fmt.Println(myStringPtr) // ADDRES IN MEMMORY 
fmt.Println(*myStringPtr) // VALUE
```
