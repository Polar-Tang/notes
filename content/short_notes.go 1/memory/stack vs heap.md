The call stack from a script goes executing the code with a stack order, as LIFO (last in, first out).

This stack it's growing and shrinking automatically as long the data no longer required.
[Another feature is that memory on the stack is automatically, and very efficiently, reclaimed when the function exits, which can be convenient for the programmer if the data is no longer required](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation#:~:text=Another%20feature%20is%20that%20memory,can%20be%20convenient%20for%20the%20programmer%20if%20the%20data%20is%20no%20longer%20required) so there's no need of a [[markdown/short_notes.go 1/memory/garbage_collector]] like in the [[heap-memory]]
