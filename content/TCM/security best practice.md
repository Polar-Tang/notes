#### Regular pathing/updates
It's very critical to path kwon cves
#### Least permission 
Allowing more permissions than the necesary could lead to security risk
#### Secure coding
Input sanitazation, validation, is necessary to prevent common vulnerabillities
#### Secure data storage
Make you sure to encrypt sensitive data.
#### Multifactor authentication
To relies on a single mecanism of authentication mechanism is [considered a weaknes]([[CWE-308("1FA")]]), enable multi-factor is a multi-layered security measure, this mean that if an attacker compromise a layer (the password) but the account has the multifactor authentication enabled, the attacker could not gain full access to the account
#### Monitoring and loggind
To montoring a loging could help to identify an attack and block it at time
#### User training 
Keep aware the user to certain action like enter something link
